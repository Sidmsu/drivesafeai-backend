- **Advanced Object Detection**: Scalable architecture ready for YOLOv5 model integration for fatigue and distraction detection
- **Multi-Modal Detection Framework**:
  - Infrastructure for fatigue detection through yawning recognition
  - Framework for distraction detection via phone usage identification
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Optional MediaPipe integration for enhanced facial landmark analysis
- **Interactive Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger UI for API testing and integration
- **Scalable Design**: Built for production deployment with FastAPI's async capabilities

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Backend Framework** | FastAPI | High-performance async web framework |
| **Deep Learning** | YOLOv5 | Custom object detection model |
| **Computer Vision** | OpenCV, MediaPipe | Image processing and facial analysis |
| **ML Framework** | PyTorch | Model inference and tensor operations |
| **Image Processing** | Pillow | Image manipulation and format handling |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Custom-trained YOLOv5 model weights (`best.pt`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sidmsu/drivesafeai-backend.git
cd drivesafeai-backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

**Model Integration (In Development)**:
The system is architected to support custom YOLOv5 models. Once your model training is complete, place the trained model file (`best.pt`) in the project root directory. The model should be trained to detect classes such as `yawn` and `phone`.

**Current State**: API endpoints and inference pipeline are implemented and ready for model integration.

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the development server
uvicorn main:app --reload

# For production deployment
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### API Documentation

Access the interactive API documentation at:
- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## API Specification

### Analyze Driver Image

**Endpoint**: `POST /analyze-image`

**Description**: Analyzes uploaded image for driver fatigue and distraction indicators

**Request Format**:
```http
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: file (image/jpeg, image/png)
```

**Response Format** (Sample - Model Integration Pending):
```json
{
  "status": "analysis_ready",

  "model_status": "pending_integration"
}
```

**Response Codes**:
- `200`: Analysis completed successfully
- `400`: Invalid image format or missing file
- `500`: Internal processing error
